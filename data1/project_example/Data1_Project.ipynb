I should mention that there are different \"categories\" of Python so to speak (you might hear them called \"stacks\" as well). You can use Python for web development (django / flask), automating database processes, automating data engineering tasks, use it for data analysis (the data stack - what we're working in), use it for microcontrollers, the list goes on and on. The most straight forward way to work with data in Python is with a module called Pandas. If you installed Anaconda, this should be included. If not, enter the following commands in your command prompt:\n","\n","```\n","Windows:\n","pip install pandas\n","```\n","\n","```\n","MacOS:\n","pip3 install pandas\n","```\n","\n","To import a package, use the ```import``` statement like I have below. If you get a \"module not found\" error, which is common, that means you don't have it installed (or Python can't find it, which is a little trickier to trouble shoot). ALWAYS put your import statements at the very, very top of your script or notebook. This is so you don't have to poke around different lines of code to see what you've imported and what you haven't. \n","\n","The core idea of a package / library / module (sometimes you'll hear the words used interchangeably, though the modules are the specific .py files and the package / library is the overall collection of files) is that other developers have written code so you don't have to. For example, if you want the sin trigonometry function, you don't have to write it yourself, you can just ```import math``` and use ```math.sin```. You'll aliases pretty frequently, like ```pd``` for pandas, or ```np``` for numpy.

to the ```DistributionAmt``` column. We would assume from the names that maybe the invoice is how much the department was billed and the distribution amount is how much was actually sent out, which could vary for a variety of reasons. Your first thought should probably always be to check the data dictionary (if one is provided) to see what the columns mean, which is [here](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/expenditures-data). Here are the definitions provided: \n","\n","**InvoiceAmt** - The amount invoiced for payment by the vendor.\n","\n","**DistributionAmt** - A breakdown of the accounting strings used to pay an invoice. Note: A single invoice amount could be split between more than one distribution.\n","\n","**CheckAmt** - The amount issued on the check to the vendor. Note: Sometimes a single check can be issued for multiple invoices. The check amount may then be larger than the invoice amount but the invoice amounts from all included invoices will add up to the total check amount.\n","\n","At this point, I would be curious based on the plot below why some of the distributions were negative, though that may represent a credit back to the department or something for excess funds paid out. Notice too how I used a mask to filter the data set then plot it. All this does is say that we want to look at things where the invoice is greater than 0 and less than 100. I did this just to fit the plot on the screen because there were some big outliers, though those are always worth looking at
