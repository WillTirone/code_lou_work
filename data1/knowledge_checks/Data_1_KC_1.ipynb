Create a GitHub repo called \"data_1_checks\". You will upload ALL knowledge checks to this repo in the future.\n","2. Send that link to your mentor so they can check it when you finish the assignment. \n","3. Make a .py (or .ipynb) file that contains the following (your choice of editor does not matter!): \n","  - a statement that prints \"hello world!\"\n","  - a list populated with several values. They can be strings / integers / floats etc. Then, print() one of those values either to the prompt or in a cell (if using Jupyter Notebook)\n","  - a dictionary populated with two keys and two values.
